### CSC 7901: Machine Learning Capstone

This capstone project will explore a graph neural network (GNN) formulation for pathway reconstruction. Traditional pathway reconstruction algorithms rely on predefined algorithm rules, but GNNs could offer a data-driven approach to learn patterns from biological interaction networks. The goal would be to train a GNN model that can predict biological pathways based on interaction data, initially focusing on a restricted setting like yeast (using the Saccharomyces Genome Database datasets)
